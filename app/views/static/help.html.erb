<h1>Help is here!</h1>

<p>Rubeque challenges users to solve ruby koans or short problems using ruby code. To do this, you'll need to fill in the blank on each problem.
The blanks that you will be filling in are indicated by "__" (two underscores).  This is not part of the syntax of Ruby and in its place, your code
will be evaluated. If there are multiple blanks, each will be replaced with your code. Any code passes all assertions will be considered a correct
answer.</p>

</p>Let's consider the first problem:</p>

<p><%=raw highlight_code("assert_equal __, true") %></p>

<p>Any of the following would be considered correct answers:</p>
<ol>
  <li>true</li>
  <li>(1 == 1)</li>
  <li>!!1</li>
</ol>
