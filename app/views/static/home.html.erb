    <p>"What is Rubeque?" you ask. Good question! Rubeque is a place to hone your Ruby skills by solving small Ruby problems while competing against other Rubyists.
    Whether you are new to Ruby or just looking to sharpen your Ruby skills, Rubeque should have something to offer.</p>

    <p>As for the problems, the premise is simple: simply fill the code box with Ruby code will be substituted for the double underscores (__) in the problem. If code
    passes the assertions, then you get points and you can move on to another problem.</p>

    <p>Once you have solved all the problems, feel free to visit <%= link_to "our github page", "https://github.com/daviddavis/rubeque" %> to contribute code.
    Alternatively, you can click <%= link_to "the new problem link", new_problem_path %> to submit a problem of your own. Also, keep checking back as new problems
    are posted on a regular basis. Good luck!</p>
